# Platformer Game with Python(Pygame).

This is a side project for me to learn more about and practice OOP( Object Oriented Programming ).
So any suggestion would be appreciated.

Note :- This game is still under development.

## What is the status of project right now?
- Player movement.
- Level Mechanics.
